# <h1 style="text-align: center">Real-Time Search Demo with Spring Boot and WebSocket</h1>

## Overview

The "Real-Time Search Demo with Spring Boot and WebSocket" is a demonstration application built with Spring Boot, a Java framework for web application development. The main focus of this demo is to illustrate the implementation of a real-time search feature using WebSocket technology.

## Key Features:

1. Instant Search Results: As users type their search queries, the application dynamically updates and displays matching results in real-time, providing a responsive search experience.
2. WebSocket Communication: The application leverages WebSocket for bi-directional communication between the client and the server, enabling efficient and real-time updates without the need for page refresh.
3. Efficient Searching: The application efficiently processes search requests on the server-side, ensuring fast response times even for large datasets.
4. No Results Handling: If no search results are found, the application gracefully notifies the user with an appropriate message, indicating that no items are available based on the search criteria.
5. Scalable and Adaptable: The demo code is designed to be easily scalable and adaptable to different search scenarios and data sources. It serves as a foundation for developers to build real-time search functionality into their own applications.

### This GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for developers who want to understand and implement real-time search functionality using Spring Boot and WebSocket technology. It provides a clear demonstration of the key concepts and code examples that can be utilized as a starting point for building similar features in their own projects.

### I am excited to showcase my demo app that highlights the core functionality of a typical web application. However, I understand that each business has its own unique requirements, which is why I am offering additional features such as forgot password, email verification, password change, user detail change, admin panel, and many more based on your specific needs. I can work with you to customize and add any additional features to the app to make it a perfect fit for your business.
